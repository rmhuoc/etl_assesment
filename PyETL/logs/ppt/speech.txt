ðŸ”· Intro: Vision

Allianz wants to become a data-driven company. But what does that really mean?
It means empowering the business to make smarter, faster, and more confident decisions â€” decisions based not on intuition, but on trusted, analyzed, and timely data.

To achieve this, Allianz needs a modern, cloud-based analytics architecture â€” scalable, secure, and built to support advanced analytics and automation at scale.
ðŸŽ¯ Business Objectives

What are the main targets that the business wants to accomplish through this transformation?

    Grow the top line above market: by identifying new revenue opportunities through customer and market insights.

    Achieve technical excellence to increase business margin: by optimizing operations and reducing inefficiencies.

    Deliver best-in-class service levels: by ensuring data quality and availability to support real-time customer interactions.

    Enable process automation: by laying the groundwork for AI and machine learning initiatives that automate repetitive and manual tasks.

ðŸ“ˆ Business Impact

So, whatâ€™s the expected impact if we successfully meet these targets?

    Up to 20% improvement in strategic reporting efficiency, freeing up time for value-added analysis.

    A 30% reduction in data operations costs, by streamlining infrastructure and eliminating redundancy.

    A drastic reduction in time-to-insight â€” from days to minutes, thanks to a modern data pipeline and self-service analytics.

    Enablement of AI-driven models, including predictive analytics for sales forecasting and customer churn prevention.

ðŸ’° Estimated Investment

To support this transformation, the estimated investment includes:

    â‚¬1M allocated to the cloud platform infrastructure (based on Azure Data Platform).

    â‚¬2M dedicated to external development and consultancy services, including architecture design, implementation, and knowledge transfer.

ðŸ‘¥ Delivery Team

The initial development team will consist of:

    3 senior data architects with deep expertise in the Azure Data Platform (covering Synapse, ADLS Gen2, Data Factory, and security).

    3 mid-level data engineers, responsible for building data pipelines, implementing data quality rules, and supporting ongoing operations.

âœ… Conclusion (optional)

With this strategy, Allianz will not only modernize its data landscape, but also unlock new opportunities for innovation, efficiency, and competitive advantage.
